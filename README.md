# RoDOS

> "It's a disk operating system, it's Rust-oriented, it's retro-inspired, no... it's **RoDOS**!"

Like the island of Rhodes in the Aegean Sea, RoDOS is built around a circular pattern - the disk - and designed to be reliable and resilient. 
Its minimalistic approach to functionality reflects the lo-fi charm of retro technology. 

But don't be fooled by its simplicity - RoDOS packs a punch with its lean and resourceful design, perfect for those who want a disk operating system that is both lightweight and responsive.
